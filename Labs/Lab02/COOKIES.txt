Walnut Snowball Cookies Recipe

Prep time: 10 minutes Cook time: 35 minutes Yield: Makes about 20 cookies

INGREDIENTS

1 cup all-purpose or cake flour
1 1/2 cups walnuts, finely chopped
2 to 3 Tbsp sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
8 tablespoons (4 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature
Pinch of salt
Powdered sugar, to coat (about 1 cup)

DIRECTIONS

1. Make the cookie dough: Mix all the dry ingredients (flour, walnuts, salt, sugar) in a large bowl. Add the vanilla extract. Add the butter in little pieces, and combine everything together with your hands until the mixture looks like a coarse meal with nut bits in it.
2. Chill the dough: Chill the dough for at least 30 minutes in the fridge or up to overnight.
3. Preheat the oven to 300Â°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment or silicon baking mats.
4. Form the dough into balls: Form the dough into small balls no larger than a walnut and place on the cookie sheet, spaced at least an inch apart from each other.
3. Bake for 35 minutes.
4. Roll in powdered sugar: When they are still warm, but cool enough to touch, roll the cookies in some powdered sugar. Set aside on a rack to cool completely. When cool, dust again in powdered sugar.
